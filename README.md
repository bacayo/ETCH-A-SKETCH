# ETCH-A-SKETCH
## What i learned?

* I learned a lot about CSS grid property. It was confusing at first how to align small grids into big container.
* I am now comfortable manipulating objects with DOM. I also learned a lot about eventListeners. Pretty good about it.
* The project looked diffucult and complicated at first glance. Building it into small pieces made it pretty easy actually.
